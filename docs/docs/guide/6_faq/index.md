# FAQ

## Can I use the same domain with subfolders for multiple apps?
No, for technical reasons, it is not possible to use the same domain with subfolders to host multiple apps. Each app must have its own separate domain.
The preferred solution is to use subdomains for each app. For example, you can use subdomains like "app-one.your-company.com", "app-two.your-company.com", and so on. Using subdomains allows you to have separate domains for each app, which avoids the technical limitations associated with using subfolders.
